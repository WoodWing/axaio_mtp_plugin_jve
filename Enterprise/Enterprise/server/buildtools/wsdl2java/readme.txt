USAGE:

You can use the batch/shell files to generate Java classes or VB/C# classes from the SC Enterprise WSDLs.
These can also be used to check if the WSDLs are valid and compatible with wsdl2java.tar and wsdl.exe tools.

Windows: Run the batch (.bat) files from the command console, for example:
	sce2jcs.bat

Macintosh: Run the shell scripts (.sh) files from the Terminal application, for example:
	sh sce2java.sh
