PRINTCHANNELFILTER


Once installed and activated, this plug-in does the following for all Layout dialogs (save, create and properties):
- it only shows 'print' type issues
- it only shows issues with a publication date between *today* and a next 
range of days (which can be configured), plus all issues without a 
publication date, plus all issues which are current (regardless their
publication date).
- it maximizes the number of issues to a configurable number, given that
the issues are sorted by order number, it will show the next N issues starting from today.


Configuration

Behavior of the plug-in is configured in config.php
