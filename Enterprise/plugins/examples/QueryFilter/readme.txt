QUERY FILTER - SERVER PLUG-IN

This plug-in hides Named Queries that have a "$" prefix from end-users.
For users with admin rights those queries are still shown.

This feature might be useful in case admin users want to use many Named Queries for 
administrative purposes. Those queries might reveal information end-users have no access
to or might blur the list of queries that are useful for them.
