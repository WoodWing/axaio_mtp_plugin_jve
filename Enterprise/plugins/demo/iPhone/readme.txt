This iPhone plug-ins optimizes Logon response and Previews for the iPhone publication Overview.

This serves a few purpuses:
- Reduce data to transmit, important when using mobile data (3G of Edge/GPRS)
- Less data means less CPU needed, which is important as iPhone CPU is not that powerful and it saves battery.

What it does:
- Any information not needed for the iPhone App is removed from the LogOn response.
- Previews are scaled down, still a bit bigger than the native resolution to allow zoom-in. Resolution can be configured in config.php.
