		Configuration file to specify how many errors are allowed per Enterprise folder.
		This file is read by the phpstorm2junit.php module.
		
		IMPORTANT:
		Since Enterprise Server 10.2 this file should NO longer be used. Instead, use the 
		Scopes feature combined with the Inspections feature in the preferences of phpStorm. 
		See https://confluence.woodwing.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=38902303
		
		HOW TO CONFIGURE: 
		- Configure most specifc (long) paths first, then more generic (short) paths.
		- Configure maxerr="0" when a folder should be free of errors.
		- Configure maxerr="1000000" when all errors of a folder should be suppressed.
