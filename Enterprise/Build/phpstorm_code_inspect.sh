# This script simulates the phpStorm Code Inspection as executed on the Zetes build machine,
# but then on your local MacOSX development machine. Assumed is that you have phpStorm installed.
#
# Usage:
# 1. Exit your phpStorm client.
# 2. Open a Terminal and enter the following commands:
#    $ cd ~/git/enterprise-server/master      (or any other branch)
#    $ sh Enterprise/Build/phpstorm_code_inspect.sh
#
# Results are filtered by usage of the Enterprise/Build/phpstorm2junit.xml config file.
# Reports are written in the Enterprise/reports folder (which is cleared before it starts).
